            report by WBEZ Chicago
        </a>, we have decided to tackle the excess amounts of Chicago's yard waste ending up in landfills.
        Although collection requests for yard waste are higher than ever, the City of Chicago is picking up
        significantly less yard waste than years past. 
     </p>
     <p>
         The city of Chicago currently uses a Yard Waste Pickup Service by 
         <a href="https://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/streets/provdrs/streets_san/svcs/yard_waste.html">311 Requests</a>. 
         When a resident requests pickup by 311, the City is sent to collect the waste and send it for composting.
     </p>
     <p>
         However, many residents do not believe their yard waste is actually sent to composts. They find it stays
         out where they left it, until it suspiciously vanishes with their trash on garbage collection days.
         Even with high rates of collection requests, less than 1% of eligible households put in collection requests.
         Clearly, the current system is not working.
