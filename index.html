            report by WBEZ Chicago
        </a>, we have decided to tackle the excess amounts of Chicago's yard waste ending up in <span class="highlight">landfills.</span>
        Although collection requests for yard waste are <span class="highlight">higher than ever</span>, the City of Chicago is picking up
        significantly less yard waste than years past. 
     </p>
     <p>
         The city of Chicago currently uses a Yard Waste Pickup Service by 
         <a href="https://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/streets/provdrs/streets_san/svcs/yard_waste.html">311 Requests</a>. 
         When a resident <span class="highlight">requests</span> pickup by 311, the City is sent to collect the waste and send it for composting.
     </p>
     <p>
         However, many residents do not believe their yard waste is actually sent to composts. They find it stays
         out where they left it, until it suspiciously vanishes with their trash on garbage collection days.
         Even with high rates of collection requests, <span class="highlight">less than 1%</span> of eligible households put in collection requests.
         Clearly, the current system is not working.
     </p>
     <h3><span class="highlight">Significance</span></h3>
     <p>Not only does yard waste take up plenty of space in landfills, it also decomposes anaerobically to produce 
         methane. Methane gas, though not as recognized as carbon dioxide, produces <span class="highlight">
             86 times</span> more warming than the
            same amount of carbon dioxide, which makes it a significant contributor to climate change. (Scientific American)
     </p>       
     <p>
            Despite landfills implementing a system to capture methane released into the air, it has
            captured only 345 million metric tons in the <span class="highlight">past twenty years</span>. That may sound like a lot, but 
            landfills release about 100 million metric tons <span class="highlight">each year</span>. 
            It simply <span class="highlight">isn't enough</span>.
