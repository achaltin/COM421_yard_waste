     <h2>Yard Waste Proposal</h2>
      <a id="Summary"><h3><span class="highlight">Summary</span></h3></a>
      <p>The city should require all yard waste to be put into marked brown paper bags. Many cities 
          around the state already utilize this method in order to clearly define which bags are 
          yard waste so that the garbage collection teams do not mistakenly take the yard waste to the landfills. 
          Brown paper bags would be mailed to eligible Chicago Households with instructions for use, and an
          order form for a year of service.</p>
          <img class="topright" src="../img/collections_by_precinct.PNG" alt="Collection Requests by Precint Graph">
      <p>During an intial pilot period, this program will be launched only in the three most requested pick-up
          districts, the 22nd, 4th, and 16th. Upon a successful pilot, the program will be launched in the entire city. 
          </p>
      <p>Adopting a paper pag system will ultimately cost a miniscule amount of the current sanitation budget 
          for the running and maintenance of waste collection vehicles, and will assist in the reduction of 
          harmful emissions they produce. 
          The paper bag system is the most efficient, since it adjusts the current 
          system without having to spend additional tax revenues. 
    </p>
      <a id="Description"><h3><span class="highlight">Description</span></h3></a>
          <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>Chicago has a few options to reach our goals of:<ul>
  <li>collecting and composting yard waste properly</li> 
  <li>following the state of Illinois’ public policy</li>
  <li>reducing the environmental effects of the currently failing system</li>
  <li>increasing resident participation to maximize the overall benefits of the program</li> 
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>As opposed to redesigning the system, we propose a slight modification to the current system along with 
   a pilot program in order to fine tune and correct all of the issues that the city has. 
  </p>
  <p>
Currently, residents are not required to use a specific type of bag or have their yard waste bags marked. As a result, 
   garbage collection teams pick up the yard waste by accident. We will require all yard waste to be put into marked 
   30-gallon brown paper bags, as many cities already do. This has successfully stopped garbage collection teams from 
   taking yard waste to the landfills in Elgin and Naperville. Brown paper bags are already available at local hardware 
   and grocery stores for convenience to Chicago residents. 
  </p>
<p>Some residents will not want to be required to purchase brown paper bags separately. To combat this issue, 
  as an initial promotion for the program, we will send each eligible household a promotional package. 
  Each package will include: <ul>
  <li>a 30-gallon brown paper bag</li>
  <li>an informational and instructional brochure</li>
  <li>a return card to opt into the return system that will replace the resident’s yard waste with a new bag at each pickup</li>
  </p>
  <p>
   The city of Chicago’s seal will be stamped on all bags in this system for convenience of the collection teams. 
   This will make it clear as to who has opted into the bag return system. This promotion was designed to encourage 
   eligible residents to participate by putting the necessary tools into the individual users’ hands, and at an affordable 
   price of $15 per year.
   </p>
          <h4>Rationale and Significance</h4>
          <p>
              Not only must the voluntary system and lack of effort implementing it be frustrating for residents,
              the huge amounts of methane gas produced by yard waste that improperly ends up in landfills contributes
              to the third largest source of climate change (EESI).
          </p>
  <p>
   There are several issues with the current yard waste management system: <ol>
<li>Not even 1% out of over 600,000 city households that are eligible for the program actually call 311 for their yard waste(Eng, 2017).
 To put things into perspective, less than 6,000 households in a city that stretches 
 237 square miles participates in the program (Facts and Statistics, 2018). Low participation indicates a failed system.</li>
<li>The increase of 311 requests over the past few years does not match the drastic drop of tonnage actually collected by the 
 yard waste collectors (Eng, 2017). Logically, an increase in requests over the years should result in an increase in the tonnage 
 collected, because the relationship should contain a positive correlation between both variables. 
 The negative correlation indicates the program is not effective, or not achieving the specific outcomes it was designed to get. </li>
<li>A multitude of participating residents have claimed that upon calling 311 and requesting yard waste pickup, the bags they 
 placed separately from their garbage and recycling bins will sit in the alley for up to a week. Numerous residents say that 
 their yard waste will disappear on the next garbage day (Heffernan, 2015). The garbage collection trucks collect the yard waste 
 that is separated according to the guidelines set forth by the Department of Streets and Sanitation. This means that yard 
 waste is being sent to the city’s landfills and is not being decomposed of properly.
  </ol>
  </p>
 <p>In 1990, the state of Illinois banned all yard waste from entering landfills to conserve landfill space, and more 
  importantly to reduce the amount of methane gas released into the atmosphere from anaerobic decompositon of yard waste
  in landfills. Methane is extremely 
  dangerous because it is twenty-five times more harmful than carbon dioxide: methane traps twenty-five times the amount of heat 
  that carbon dioxide does, causing an exponential increase in the average 
  global temperature (Brockway, 2012). The City of Chicago is blatantly failing to follow the State Environmental Protection Agency’s 
  policy with the tons of yard waste that they are allowing to make it to the landfills.
 </p>
          <h4>Plan of Work</h4>
            <h5>Scope</h5>
 <p>
  A pilot program will first launchin three neighborhoods across the city:<ul>
 <li>South Chicago, 4th District, representing the South Side</li>
 <li>Jefferson Park, 16th District, representing the North Side</li>
 <li>Morgan Park, 22nd District, representing the West Side</li>
 </p>
 <p>
 The three neighborhoods that were selected had the highest amount of 311 requests over the past three years on each side of the city. 
  This pilot program will demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the adjusted yard waste management program. The results 
  from this pilot program will assist in marketing a successful program to non-participating residents. It will also give quantitative 
  data on when the right time will be to update various neighborhoods from the 311 removal request to regularly scheduled biweekly 
  pickups. 
 </p>
 <img class="topright" alt="Chicago 311 Collections by Month" src="../img/collections_by_month.PNG"/>
 <img class="topright" alt="Proposed pickup schedule" src="../img/collection_schedule.JPG"/>
 <p>
  The pilot program is anticipated to run for a year, and then launch citywide upon success and modification with the data collected.
  The pilot program pickup schedule is based on 311 reqeusts, and will be adjusted based on participation and amounts collected.
 </p>
            <h5>Methods</h5>
 <p>To support the effectiveness of the pilot program, data will be collected on: <ul>
 <li>Smog test emmissions from the collection truck</li>
 <li>Pounds of tonnage collected and properly composted</li>
 <li>Neighborhood partipation by numbers of participants</li>
 <li>Cost of the program in fuel, vehicle maintenance, and salary expenses</li>
 </ul>
 </p>
<p>
 The data will then be analyzed to create an optimal program for citywide scope.
 </p>
<p>As supplement to the plan, we will launch our Twitter account to spread awareness of:<ul>
 <li>the changes to Chicago’s yard waste management program</li>
 <li>the importance of global warming</li>
 <li>how the old system was exponentially increasing the effects on the global temperature</li>
 <li>the significance of the quantitative data we collect</li> 
 <li>insights from our data to improve the system</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Educating the public will dramatically increase the participation of the program, because many simply lack 
understanding of the dangers of incorrectly disposed yard waste.
</p>

            <h5>Task Breakdown</h5>
<p>In one years time from the start of the pilot program, we plan to have enough reputable data to finalize the proposed pickups schedule for the rest of the city, by pinpointing trends in the pilot. By year three, we expect to have more than 50% of eligible residents participating in the program.  And by year five, we expect more than 75% to be participating. We expect 99% of eligible residents to be participating after ten years. 
</p>
            <h5>Problem Analysis</h5>
<p>There may be some backlash through the social media account and website. To counter the possible negative replies, we will maintain a professional posture and continue to provide educational responses that are backed by scientific fact in order to sustain our good standing as a credible and reliable source. 
</p>
          <h4>Facilities and Equipment</h4>
<p>No new equipment or facilities will be required. The Department of Streets and Sanitation will utilize the same waste collection trucks and composting facilities. Scheduled yard waste pickups will occur on Wednesdays, when the large collection trucks are not in use. Small pickup trucks will continue to be used for the by-request pickups.
</p>
          <a id="Personnel"><h3><span class="highlight">Personnel</span></h3></a>
<p>The plan requires that the Department of Streets and Sanitation hire two additional part-time employees per police district for yard waste collection. There are 22 police districts. This puts our total number of additional employees required at 44. 
</p>
          <a id="Budget"><h3><span class="highlight">Budget</span></h3></a>
<p>The total cost for the pilot program is $242,900. Since the new employees will work on incrementally scheduled pickups, 
 their salaries are budgeted to be approximately two-thirds that of a full-time refuse collection employee. </p>  
<img src="../img/budget.JPG" alt="budget table" class="topright"/>
 <p>
  For the whole city rollout, the total cost of the program is $2,338,000 per year. At our end goal with 99% participation we expect 
  to get $1,800,000 in revenues from approximately 600,000 eligible households. Households will be charged $15 per year to participate 
  in the yard waste program. $12 covers the cost of the 30 bags and $3 goes towards the cost of paying the collectors. 
  This leaves $538,000 that would need to be added to the existing budget in order to cover the remaining salaries of new employees. 
  Until our ultimate goal of a 99% participation rate, the city will have to make up the difference, however the cost assuming 0% 
  participation would be only 1.33% of the current budget. The Department of Streets and Sanitation has a current budget of more 
  than $150,000,000. With goal participation, the increased budget would only be 0.33%. 
</p>
          <a id="Conclusion"><h3><span class="highlight">Conclusion</span></h3></a>
<p>Chicago’s poor yard waste management system is a government failure and contributes immensely to global warming. Our simple and inexpensive modification requiring the use of brown paper bags will immediately reduce the harmful methane gas being produced in landfills. With a one-year pilot program launching in three well-separated neighborhoods, we plan to tune the efficiency and effectiveness of the yard waste management program to utilize tax revenues to the highest proficiency possible and reduce the exponential damage occurring to the earth.
